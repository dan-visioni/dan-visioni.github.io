Abstract:
The artificial injection of sulfate aerosols (Stratospheric Aerosol Injections, SAI) or their precursors (such as gaseous SO2), in the lower stratosphere, in order to produce an optically thick cloud capable of cooling the planet, is being discussed more and more as a possible, temporary, way to counteract the harmful effects of greenhouse gases (GHGs) induced surface warming. Understanding all the side effects of the perturbation that would be produced by the artificial aerosol layer is crucial in order to inform the public and policymakers about the feasibility and safety of this strategy as a complement to GHGs reduction and removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. 

The main way in which we can explore most of these effects is through the use of global climate models: however, many past climate model simulations of geoengineering have used a uniform reduction of the incoming solar radiation as a proxy for stratospheric aerosols, both because many models are not designed to adequately capture relevant stratospheric aerosol processes, and because a solar reduction has often been assumed to capture the most important differences between how stratospheric aerosols and GHG would affect the climate, even thought this has recently been proven not to be true.

Here in particular I will discuss the projected effects on the stratospheric composition and dynamics of the artificial aerosol layer: while the particles would reflect a portion of the incoming solar radiation, they would also absorb part of the infrared radiation, locally warming the lower tropical stratosphere and producing changes in stratospheric circulation; this would also result in complex changes in the stratospheric ozone layer, which would depend on altitude (because of the predominance of different ozone-formation processes), temporal period of the injection (due to the different load of ozone-depleting substances during the 21st century) and latitude. Furthermore, the overall effect would depend on the exact SAI strategy: how much sulfate is being injected and where. 

Results from multiple state-of-the-art climate models (CESM1(WACCM), CESM2(WACCM6), CNRM-ESM2-1 and UKESM1-0-LL) indicate that, depending on the specific response of each model to the aerosol perturbation, by the end of the century (2018-2100) a change in Southern Hemisphere (SH) total ozone column (TCO) in October of between -10 and -40 DU is projected by the models in a scenario considering SAI compared to a scenario with high emissions (SSP5-8.5); between 20ºN and 20ºS, on the other hand, models agree on a projected TCO increase of around 20 DU. Major uncertainty sources between models in the projected changes can be identified through the use of ad-hoc simulations which exclude the chemical effect of the increased surface area density (SAD) by the aerosols, but retain the dynamical effect produced by the aerosol-induced stratospheric heating. These experiments highlight areas of improvement in Earth System models to better constrain the projected changes that would be produced by SAI.
