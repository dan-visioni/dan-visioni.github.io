Here's a list of all the articles I've worked on: they are divided by those I've worked on as lead author (under <b>Main Publications</b>) and those that I contributed to (under <b>Other Publications</b>).  I try not to care too much about publication metrics, but one I'm particularly proud about is the fact that I have collaborated with [240](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57190047135) coauthors to date! As you can see from the list, my publications span various topics: geoengineering, climatic impact of volcanic eruption, modeling of atmospheric composition and circulation, stratospheric ozone and yes, astrobiology.

Visit the the page related to each article to download the PDF or e-mail me if you're interested.
