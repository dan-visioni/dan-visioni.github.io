Here's a list of all the articles I've worked on: they are divided by those I've worked on as lead author (under <b>Main Publications</b>) and those that I contributed to (under <b>Other Publications</b>).  I try not to care too much about publication metrics, but one I'm particularly proud about is the fact that I have collaborated with [288](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57190047135) coauthors to date! As you can see from the list, my publications span various topics: climate intervention and mitigation, climatic impact of volcanic eruption, modeling of atmospheric composition and circulation, stratospheric ozone and yes, astrobiology.

My publication philosophy: I like doing research that excites me, and that I feel it is useful to my overarching goal: how do we inform the world about potential options for mitigating climate change risks. This involves many thing: understanding current and future impacts, improving forecasting tools, building confidence and robustness in those tools, and building a strong and inclusive community capable of doing all that. Publications are a way to inform others, openly, about all potential advances, problems and ideas. Every publication is a brick towards building something bigger, that everyone will be able to use. Sometimes a paper can be wrong - and that's ok! But have we still learned something from it? A good publication, in the long run, is not necessarily one that ends up in every newspaper: it often is the one that allows many other future papers from the rest of the community to end up in a newspaper!
