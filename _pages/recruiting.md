* Yes, I am currently recruiting potential postdoctoral researchers for the many projects we have going here at Cornell. If you're a PhD, or about to graduate, and interested to join our group, please send an email to me and Doug MacMartin (dmg224@cornell.edu) with a CV and tell us what you'd like to work on and why you'd like to join the lab. More info are available [here](https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/douglas/research/).

* No, I am currently not recruiting graduate students. The application process for the Cornell Graduate Program for 2024 is currently closed. Check back in the Fall and I'll let you know if I'm recruiting again!

* Yes, I am currently recruiting undergraduate researchers. If you're a Cornell Undergrad and are interested to do summer research, a Honour Thesis or a research project, send me an email or drop by my office and I'll be happy to chat! If you're not at Cornell it might be harder, but if you have ideas/proposals do write.

* I have decided not to consider High School students for research projects or mentorship. I don't have the capacity, nor the pedagogical tool, to make this a good experience for you. I empathise with the pressure to have a good CV to attend the school of your dreams, but I think it's unfair to ask students to start research so early, and your value is not connected to the list of papers you might have at 18 (or at 35!).
