I like to contribute to Science Communication efforts, by writing articles explaining climate science to the general public (my mom likes them!), or giving public talks (she also thinks I look nice when I do those!). I like to do this both in English and in my first language, Italian (so that my mom can understand, but also because I like to keep in touch with my home country!). Things are tagged accordingly.

You can find some of my shorter musings in the [blog](https://dan-visioni.github.io/year-archive/), and below a list of articles on websites/newspapers I was asked to write or I was interviewed for, podcasts I participated to and public talks I gave.
