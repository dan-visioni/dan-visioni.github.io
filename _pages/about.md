Hi there! I'm Dan, and I'm a climate modeler. My main area of expertise is the behavior of stratospheric aerosols and how they interact with atmospheric chemistry and with the surface climate. I am currently a Research Associate at Cornell University, Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, working with [prof. Douglas MacMartin](https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/douglas/) on our Geoengineering Assessment across Uncertainties, Scenarios, and Strategies [GAUSS](https://climate-engineering.mae.cornell.edu/gauss-geoengineering-assessment-across-uncertainty-scenarios-and-strategies/) project.

My research is currently focused on studying Sulfate Geoengineering, a form of climate engineering that aims to partially, temporarily, offset the effects of climate change by means of injecting sulfate precursors in the stratosphere in order to reflect a small part of the incoming solar radiation and thus reduce global temperatures. I'm also interested in other climate engineering methods (Marine Cloud Brightening, Cirrus Thinning) and I continue studying the effect of past and present volcanic eruptions on climate. If you are curious about climate engineering, you can find a primer our group wrote [here](https://www.srmprimer.org/) intended for a general audience. 

I work to improve our understanding of how different deployment strategies would impact the surface climate differently, and how (and if!) we can minimise these impacts. Climate engineering is not to be intended as a way to avoid getting to zero emissions as fast as possible, but I strongly believe we need to explore it as a complementary measure to reduce some of the unavoidable impacts that climate change might have on our lives: see [this perspective I coauthored](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221209632100053X) and [this opinion piece we wrote](https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/559859-climate-engineering-research-is-essential-to-a-just-transition-and).

My research spans various topics:

* The international governance aspect of climate engineering [(13)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221209632100053X), and the integration of climate engineering in more inclusive, comprehensive scenarios of future climate change [(15)](https://ecologyandsociety.org/vol26/iss4/art30/)

(A more comprehensive list of my publications can be found [here](https://dan-visioni.github.io/publications/))

I am currently co-chair of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project ([GeoMIP](http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/GeoMIP/)), and participate actively in other MIPs: 
[ISA-MIP](http://isamip.eu/home) and [CCMI](https://igacproject.org/activities/CCMI). I am a research collaborator for the Solar Radiation Management Governance Initiative ([SRMGI](https://www.srmgi.org/decimals-fund/the-research-collaborators/)), which aims to put developing countries at the centre of the geoengineering conversation. I also like mentoring university students: I'm an active participant in a Cornell University program aimed at mentoring First-Generation undergraduate students, and in an online program aimed at mentoring Italian STEM students looking for an academic career abroad.

I also try to be active in communicating climate science and the risks of climate change to a broader audience - visit my [Science Communication](https://dan-visioni.github.io/scicomm/) page to look at some examples.

You can contact me ad dv224 -at- cornell dot edu. If you have questions about what I do or my publications - or if you are a student looking for advices on how to navigate the academic environment - don't hesitate to contact me!

In my free time (as if!) I love practicing historical fencing and hiking around nature with my husband (both the fencing and the hiking) reading SciFi and comics and running.
