Hi there! I'm Dan, and I'm a climate modeler. My main area of expertise is the behavior of stratospheric aerosols and how they interact with atmospheric chemistry and with the surface climate. I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Cornell University, Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, working with [prof. Douglas MacMartin](https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/douglas/) on our newly funded Geoengineering Assessment across Uncertainties, Scenarios, and Strategies [GAUSS](https://climate-engineering.mae.cornell.edu/gauss-geoengineering-assessment-across-uncertainty-scenarios-and-strategies/) project.

My research is currently focused on studying Sulfate Geoengineering, a form of climate engineering that aims to reduce surface temperatures by means of injecting sulfate precursors in the stratosphere in order to reflect a small part of the incoming solar radiation and thus reduce global temperatures. I'm also interested in other climate engineering methods (Marine Cloud Brightening, Cirrus Thinning) and I continue studying the effect of past and present volcanic eruptions on climate.

I work to improve our understanding of how different deployment strategies would impact the surface climate differently, and how (and if!) we can minimise these impacts. 

To do so, my research spans various topics:  

* The interactions between aerosols and atmospheric dynamics [(1)](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/2787/2018/acp-18-2787-2018.html), [(2)](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/17/11209/2017/acp-17-11209-2017.html), [(3)](https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-1104/) and chemistry [(4)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL089470?af=R) [(5)](https://www.essoar.org/doi/10.1002/essoar.10504448.1)
* The physical mechanisms and sources of uncertainties [(6)](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/17/3879/2017/acp-17-3879-2017.html) in aerosols microphysics and aerosol-clouds interaction [(7)](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/14867/2018/acp-18-14867-2018.html) in climate models 
* The space of possible strategies [(8)](https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/11/1051/2020/esd-11-1051-2020.html) for controlling various climate metrics through injections at different locations and times of year [(9)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL083680)
* The impacts on ecosystems [(10)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab94eb) and surface climate [(11)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL085758) [(12)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL088337)
* The international governance aspect of climate engineering

(A more comprehensive list of my publications can be found [here](https://dan-visioni.github.io/publications/))

I am currently co-chair of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project ([GeoMIP](http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/GeoMIP/)), and participate actively in other MIPs: 
[ISA-MIP](http://isamip.eu/home) and [CCMI](https://igacproject.org/activities/CCMI). I also like mentoring university students: I'm an active participant in a Cornell University program aimed at mentoring First-Generation undergraduate students, and in an online program aimed at mentoring Italian STEM students looking for an academic career abroad.

I also try to be active in communicating climate science and the risks of climate change to a broader audience - visit my [Science Communication](https://dan-visioni.github.io/scicomm/) page to look at some examples.

You can contact me ad dv224 -at- cornell dot edu. If you have questions about what I do or my publications - or if you are a student looking for advices on how to navigate the academic environment - don't hesitate to contact me!

In my free time (as if!) I love practicing historical fencing and hiking around nature with my husband (both the fencing and the hiking) reading SciFi and comics and running.
