I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Cornell University, Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. I'm a climate modeler and my main interest is the behavior of stratospheric aerosols and how they interact with atmospheric chemistry and with the surface climate. 

My research is currently focused on studying Sulfate Geoengineering, a form of climate engineering that aims to reduce surface temperatures by means of injecting sulfate precursors in the stratosphere in order to reflect a small part of the incoming solar radiation and thus reduce global temperatures. I'm also interested in other climate engineering methods (Marine Cloud Brightening, Cirrus Thinning) and I continue studying the effect of past and present volcanic eruptions on climate.

I work towards a deeper understanding how different deployment strategies would impact the surface climate differently, and how we can minimise these impacts. 
To do so, my research spans 

* The physical mechanisms and sources of uncertainties in aerosols microphysics and aerosol-clouds interaction in climate models 
* The space of possible strategies for controlling various climate metrics through injections at different locations and times of year 
* The impacts on ecosystems and surface climate 
* The international governance aspect of climate engineering.
