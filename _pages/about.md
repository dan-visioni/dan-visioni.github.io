I'm a climate modeler. My main area of expertise is the behavior of stratospheric aerosols and how they interact with atmospheric chemistry and with the surface climate. I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Cornell University, Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, working with [prof. Douglas MacMartin](https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/douglas/)

My research is currently focused on studying Sulfate Geoengineering, a form of climate engineering that aims to reduce surface temperatures by means of injecting sulfate precursors in the stratosphere in order to reflect a small part of the incoming solar radiation and thus reduce global temperatures. I'm also interested in other climate engineering methods (Marine Cloud Brightening, Cirrus Thinning) and I continue studying the effect of past and present volcanic eruptions on climate.

I work towards a deeper understanding of how different deployment strategies would impact the surface climate differently, and how we can minimise these impacts. 

To do so, my research spans 

* The interactions between aerosols and atmospheric [dynamics](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/2787/2018/acp-18-2787-2018.html) and [chemistry](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/17/11209/2017/acp-17-11209-2017.html)
* The physical mechanisms and [sources of uncertainties](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/17/3879/2017/acp-17-3879-2017.html) in aerosols microphysics and [aerosol-clouds interaction](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/14867/2018/acp-18-14867-2018.html) in climate models 
* The space of possible [strategies](https://esd.copernicus.org/preprints/esd-2020-58/#discussion) for controlling various climate metrics through injections at [different locations and times of year](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL083680)
* The impacts on [ecosystems](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab94eb) and [surface](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL085758) [climate](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL088337)
* The international governance aspect of climate engineering

I am part of various Model Intercomparison Projects, setting up simulations and analysing results, mainly [GeoMIP](http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/GeoMIP/), [ISA-MIP](http://isamip.eu/home) and [CCMI](https://igacproject.org/activities/CCMI).
